# React App

This project now reflects the default React starter experience.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server with live reload.
- `npm run build` – create a production build in `dist`.
- `npm run preview` – serve the most recent production build for a quick check.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint across the project.

Static assets from `public` are copied to `dist` whenever one of the scripts runs.
